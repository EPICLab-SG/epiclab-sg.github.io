                The Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab is dedicated to advancing the principles necessary
                to
                developing epistemically intelligent systems, i.e. machine learning systems that can recognise, reason
                about,
                and communicate the limits of their knowledge.

                To achieve this, our research spans foundational theory to translational applications, focusing on
                knowledge-level
                uncertainty, commonly referred to as epistemic uncertainty.

                    <markorange><strong>Mathematical Foundations of Epistemic Uncertainty:</strong></markorange>
                    We investigate the mathematical and statistical structures underlying
                    knowledge-level uncertainty. Our work examines formal representation frameworks (e.g., single
                    probability measures, sets of distributions, and higher-order models), principled quantification
                    strategies (e.g., information-theoretic and discrepancy-based characterisations),
                    methods for comparison and geometry (e.g., probability metrics and statistical distances), and
                    procedures for empirical verification (e.g., statistical testing and model
                    criticism). This research draws on tools from probability theory, imprecise probability, Bayesian
                    statistics, information theory, statistical inference and testing, and cooperative game theory.

                    <markblue><strong>Algorithms for Epistemic Uncertainty-Aware Learning:</strong></markblue>
                    We design and analyse machine learning algorithms that explicitly model, propagate, and exploit
                    epistemic uncertainty across the learning pipeline. Our work focuses on uncertainty-aware predictive
                    modelling (e.g., Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, credal predictors, and conformal
                    prediction methods),
                    structured inference under incomplete or ambiguous information (e.g., causal, counterfactual, and
                    strategic
                    learning), and decision-making under uncertainty (e.g., active learning and Bayesian optimisation).
                    Emphasis is placed on statistical validity, robustness to distributional
                    shift, computational efficiency, and principled uncertainty communication, enabling learning systems
                    to support reliable reasoning and decision processes in open-world settings.

                    </markgreen>
                    We operationalise our theoretical and algorithmic advances by developing uncertainty-aware AI
                    systems and methodological frameworks for real-world deployment. Our work investigates how
                    epistemic uncertainty can be leveraged to improve reliability, safety, and robustness in complex
                    learning environments, with applications spanning interpretable and explainable models,
                    out-of-distribution detection, robustness under distributional shift, incentive-aware and
                    adversarial learning, AI safety, and foundation / language models. A central objective is the design
                    of systems that can recognise the limits of their knowledge, adapt to novel conditions, and
                    communicate uncertainty in a manner conducive to human oversight and decision-making.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Why are we doing this?</strong> We believe that, although modern machine learning systems have
            achieved remarkable success in predictive and
            generative tasks — demonstrating powerful abilities to model statistical variability and patterns — their
            capacity to reason about uncertainty beyond observed data regularities remains fundamentally limited. In
            particular, forms of uncertainty arising from ignorance, ambiguity, and broader unknown-unknowns are not
            adequately captured by purely pattern-driven approaches. As reliance on such systems continues to grow,
            these
            limitations may lead to deeper structural challenges for reliability, robustness, and safety.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This gap motivates our research, which seeks to treat uncertainty as a first-class object of study rather
            than a secondary by-product of prediction. Our goal is to develop rigorous theory and algorithms to enable
            learning systems to represent,
            reason
            about, and communicate the limits of their knowledge — making uncertainty more than merely an afterthought
            or a set
            of error bars.</p>
